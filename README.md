# Exploratory data analysis of an Hospital Admission using SQL

---

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes patient demographics and hospital admissions data to understand trends in patient age, ethnicity, common diagnoses, and admission patterns. The goal is to provide insights into patient demographics, the nature of admissions, hospital stay durations, and the pathways through which patients enter and exit the hospital system. Using SQL, we delve into a dataset to extract, categorize, and summarize this data.

## Objective(s)

The key objectives of this analysis are:
- To analyze various aspects of patient demographics and hospital admissions.
- To inform healthcare providers about patient demographics, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient care strategies.
- To provide insights into patient demographics, nature of admissions, hospital stay durations, pathways through which patients enter and exit the hospital system.

## Dataset(s)

The **Demographics & Admissions** dataset comprises of a variety of fields related to patients admission details.
- **Source**: Public dataset provided via DuckDb.
- **Features**: Patient ID, age, ethnicity, admission date, discharge date, diagnosis, type and source of admission, discharge destination, insurance coverage type, and emergency department.

## Tools & Technologies

This project utilized the following tools and technologies:
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: To host and query the dataset.
- **SQL**: For data extraction and analysis

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data to ensure consistency in format, especially for categorical fields like ethnicity and admission types.
2. **Admission Analysis**: Analyze admission trends and break down admissions by days, calculate total admissions, categorize admissions by type.

## Results & Insights

Key insights derived from the analysis:
- **Common Diagnosis by Age Group**: Age-based diagnosis trend provides insight into the resource demands and specialization needs for different patient demographics.
- **Admissions Patterns**: The majority of admissions were from the ED, and emergency admissions were more common on weekends.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

This analysis highlights the critical areas of patient demographics and admission characteristics that influence hospital resource allocation and care strategies. It also informs policy decisions related to patient care quality, especially for demographics that may require specialized or extended care.
